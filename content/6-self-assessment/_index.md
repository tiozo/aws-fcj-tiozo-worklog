# Self-Assessment

During my internship at Amazon Web Services Vietnam Company Limited from September 8, 2025 to December 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in projects involving Cloud Infrastructure, Machine Learning deployment with SageMaker, and Fraud Detection systems, through which I improved my skills in AWS services, Terraform, Python, System Design, and Linux Administration.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
