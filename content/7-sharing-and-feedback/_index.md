The working environment at AWS FCJ is very friendly and open. Team members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, helping me focus better on my tasks. The collaborative atmosphere makes it easy to approach colleagues and mentors for guidance.

### 2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin

The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains concepts clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks efficiently, provides necessary documents promptly, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer, which helps me develop problem-solving skills.

### 3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major

The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, particularly in areas of cloud computing, system administration, and software development. The internship also introduced me to new technologies and practices I had never encountered before, such as Terraform, SageMaker, and production-level system design. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills that are highly relevant to my career goals.

### 4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities

During the internship, I learned many new skills including:
- AWS cloud services and infrastructure management
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

- Linux system administration and networking
- System design principles and patterns
- Professional communication in a corporate environment
- Technical documentation and knowledge sharing

The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path and understand industry best practices.

### 5. Company Culture & Team Spirit

The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still maintains an enjoyable atmosphere. Team members collaborate effectively and support one another regardless of their position. The regular events like AWS Cloud Mastery Series and Community Days foster a strong sense of community. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.
